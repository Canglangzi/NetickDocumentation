# Netick Documentation

Welcome to the Netick documentation repository. This repository contains all the source files for the Netick 2 documentation (https://netick.net/docs/2). Anyone is welcome to contribute!

## Editing
We use DocFX tool for building and hosting documentation online. It supports markdown style files (.md) as it's a very standardized and popular format. Writing technical documentation using markdown style is easy and efficient.

To edit docs we recommend you to use tools such as Zettlr or Typora or Visual Studio Code.
